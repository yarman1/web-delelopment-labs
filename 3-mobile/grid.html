        Marius Streicher was born in Düsseldorf, Germany. He was raised by his uncle who was a mechanic with the Bundespolizei (BPOL) Aviation Group. As a result, Streicher was around engines and motors at an early age. While he demonstrated skills in mechanics, it didn't hold the challenge that he was looking for. Since he had an affinity for complex machinery, his uncle encouraged him to study aeronautical engineering at university, but the strict academic form was an uncomfortable fit for him. So while Streicher's grades were acceptable, he had a tendency toward restless antics. Following his hobby and passion for flying, he spent considerable time around pilots and aircraft.
